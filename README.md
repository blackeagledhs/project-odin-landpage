## Overview

Download the design images to get a clear idea of what you’ll be creating:
- **Image One**: Full Design
- **Image Two**: Colors and Fonts

The **Hero Text** is the main statement that appears at the top of the web page.

## Steps to Tackle the Project

Building a project like this can feel overwhelming, especially when starting with a blank HTML document. Here’s a suggested approach to help you get started:

1. **Take it one section at a time.**
   The website has four main sections (plus a footer). Focus on completing one section before moving to the next. Starting at the top is always a good plan.

2. **Start with the content.**
   For each section, begin by adding all the HTML content to the page before styling it with CSS. It’s okay to revisit the HTML later as you refine your styles, but separating these steps will save time and reduce frustration.

3. **Stick to one CSS file.**
   There’s no need to use multiple stylesheets for this project. A single CSS file is sufficient.

4. **Leverage what you’ve learned.**
   Many elements in this project are similar to what you practiced in the flexbox exercises. If needed, revisit those exercises for a quick refresher.

## Additional Notes

- You don’t need to optimize the website for mobile devices at this stage; responsive design will be covered later.
- When you finish, make sure to push your project to GitHub to showcase your work.
